This project is a tutorial I found for Flask that makes a simple blog posting site, right now its just following the tutorial, but I might update it to add features. To run this project I installed venv on my machine and activated it to be in a virtual environment. I then, of course, had to pip install flask as this project was all about learning how to utilize flask. To run the test folder I also needed to use pytest and coverage so I later pip installed pytest coverage
